💡 This was one of my first personal projects since I began studying HTML & CSS on my own, and one of my final project ideas for the Coderhouse's Web Development course. It's a landing page about Nintendo's New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe.

👉 It has the following characteristics:\
1️⃣ Fully made with flexbox.\
2️⃣ Designed for 1080p.\
3️⃣ Non-responsive.
